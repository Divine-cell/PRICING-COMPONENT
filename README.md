This project idea was gotten from #Frontend Mentor
The idea is to create a toggle botton that displays the annual and monthly price of a product when clicked

Users are able to:
View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard

My process
Built with
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
CSS flexbox
JavaScript

What I learned
From this project, i was able to understand under css keyframes property, which enabled me to add little animation to the project.
Also, i leart better ways to give functionaly to an properties, focusing more on building my JavaScript skill


Continued development
In future projects, i want to focus on being able to give functionality to more components and also build more animations.

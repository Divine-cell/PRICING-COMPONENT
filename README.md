This project idea was gotten from #Frontend Mentor
The idea is to create a toggle botton that displays the annual and monthly price of a product when clicked

USERS ARE ABLE TO:

View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard


BUILT WITH

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
CSS flexbox
JavaScript

WHAT I LEARNED

From this project, i was able to understand under css keyframes property, which enabled me to add little animation to the project.
Also, i leart better ways to give functionaly to an properties, focusing more on building my JavaScript skill


CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

In future projects, i want to focus on being able to give functionality to more components and also build more animations.
